This project is the summary of everything i learnt in HTML and CSS. Also, i didn't add any bootstraps framework to my project, might be trying that in subsequent projects. I'm working on the site responsiveness for now, trying to make changes to my repository cause the site is live already. Moving on to the next programming language, JS.
